# Scripts folder
This directory contains most of primarily Python/TypeScript scripts (possibly other scripts
of different language types) that aid developers and admins in setting up,
configuring, and cleaning up resources used by your cloud vendors. Manually
creating these requires a bunch of easy to forget steps, so we've done the hard
work of entering them for you!
